Bio-reactors slowly filtered the fluid into vertical plasmid sacs that feed into LARGE BINS.The Farmer wears thick protective gear from head to toe.  Hood and goggles cover his face.  He takes up a handful of NEMATODES, pleased with his crop.  Looks up as --THE SPINNER SOARS OVERHEAD.The Farmer sets down his rake.EXT. FARMHOUSE.The Spinner lands in the open field behind the house, kicking up a PLUME of DUST that briefly obscures it.A small flitty HOVERCRAFT ejects itself from the back of the Spinner, A PILOTFISH.K emerges from the dust.  Whatever color his coat was, it’s brown now. K instructs with the Pilotfish with a gesture.  It TAKES OFF.K approaches the peeling-paint farmhouse.  ONE TREE in sight, a giant, DEAD, leafless thing.  A ghost of grandiosity, standing only thanks to a brace and wires staked down.INT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.K crosses creaking floors.  Looks around:  Kalsomined walls, pitted windows.  All old, but clean.  Someone takes pride.  Basic furniture, an UPRIGHT PIANO.  Otherwise EMPTY.  No decor, shelves BARE.K inspects the few items.  Sheet music for CHOPIN on the piano.  An aquarium in which COWSLIPS grow...A pot of something fragrant simmers on the stove...  K leans into the pot, sniffs deeply, when --HEAVY FOOTSTEPS come from outside.  Rattling the whole house.K re-lids the pot, as -- 2.EXT. FARMHOUSE. CONTINUOUS.The Farmer approaches his home.  Air HISSES in at the unfastening of his MASK.  He eyes the Spinner parked beyond the tree. Sees the Pilotfish hovering above. Pulls a chain.  A DECONTAMINATION SHOWER rains over his suit, which he can now unsnap.This is SAPPER MORTON.  Weathered 60s.  A well-broken nose.  Yet he pulls from his belt satchel a set of dainty glasses.  INT. FARMHOUSE. CONTINUOUSTHE DOOR OPENS.  Sapper steps in.  The floor creaks under his weight.He scans the room.  Empty.  Sapper moves to a sink where he violently scrubs his hands.  He does not yet see K.K leans from a shadow into the light.  A stranger, suddenly visible.  Briefly ominous.  An uncertain moment...K(polite)Hope you don’t mind me taking the liberty.  Wind’s a bit unkind out there.  I was careful not to track in any dirt.Sapper eyes K’s chummy posture. Dismisses any threat.SAPPERI do not mind dirt.  I do mind unannounced visits.  You police?KSapper Morton... Civic number NK680514?SAPPERI’m a farmer.K(genuinely interested)I saw that.  What do you farm?SAPPERThis is a protein farm.  Wallace design.Sapper fishes a clod off his boot and pulls off a single wriggling WORM.SAPPER (cont’d)It only takes the one to start.  Parthenogenic strain.  Constant doubling.  They’ll fill as much dirt as you can wet. 3.KIs that what I smell?K looks to that inviting pot on the stove.  Sapper shakes his head, pleased with himself.  Opens a cupboard, where a grow light nourishes PLANTS.  A few FLOWERS.  And a bottle terrarium full of GREEN SHOOTS.SAPPERGrow this just for me.  Garlic.KGarlic.He looks.  The pot on the stove bubbles and steams.SAPPERWhole town farmed it back once.  Smelled this good a hundred miles in circle.Try some?KNo thank you.  I prefer to keep a cold stomach until the hard part of the day’s behind me.  How long you been here?SAPPERSince ’20.  Came by it honest too if that’s what you’re after.KBut you weren’t a farmer prior.Sapper cocks his head at the comment.  K notes the SATCHEL at  his belt.K (cont’d)That bag... colonial medical use, isn’t it?  Military issue.  Heat resistant.  Where were you...  Calantha?  Must’ve been brutal.  Not many who survived bothered to come back to ground.A beat.  Sapper’s expression darkens.  He takes off his glasses puts them in his satchel.SAPPERPlanning on taking me in?  Huh?  Take a look inside.  See what they missed.REVEAL:  Sapper has A SCALPEL from his satchel.  Not likely.KIf taking you in is an option, I’d much prefer that over the alternative. 4.K puts his gun on the table.K (cont’d)You had to know it’d be someone in time.  Sorry it’s me.K stands and retrieves a small SCANNER from his pocket. SAPPERGood as any.K activates the scanner.KIf you’d look up and to the left please.The FIGHT is quick and it is fierce:Sapper stabs towards K’s heart.  K avoids the blade, only his coat and the wall are pierced by Sapper’s knife now stuck deep into the wall.  K breaks Sapper’s hold on the knife, which skids to the floor.K DUCKS a heavy fist that sinks into the wall where his head just was.  Sapper grabs K by his belt and collar, lifting him into the air and slamming him into the wall over and over -- until K’s body GOES THROUGH IT, and --K crashes onto the floor in the next room.K recovers quickly, strangely able to withstand the punishment.  He sees Sapper charge through the wall to finish the job.Sapper is on him -- a vice lock around K’s throat -- K gasping for air. K gets out of Sapper’s grip, and lashes out in rapid succession, his solar plexus, his chin, his throat, crushing his windpipe.  His blows are SURGICAL, anatomically precise, like viper bites.Sapper is stunned, choking, in pain.  K kicks Sappers’ knee and the giant drops to the floor like a felled oak tree.K SNATCHES Sapper’s THROAT -- SQUEEZING -- thumb SLIDING UPWARD as -- Sapper GASPS... FLAILS... hand reaching...For the dropped SCALPEL... GRASPING IT!HE STABS K in the SHOULDER.K accepts the wound and the pain.  Only squeezes tighter. 5.Sapper’s EYES ROLL BACK -- the desired effect -- REVEALING:  A PINPRICK OF COLOR on the underside of the right EYEBALL.K draws the SCANNER -- which reads the point like a bar code.  It confirms Sapper’s ID.K stops holding back -- SNAPS Sapper’s remaining good arm -- grabs his GUN that has fallen on the floor beside the table.K (cont’d)Please don’t get up.Sapper raises up still fighting for air.SAPPERHow does it feel, killing your own kind?KI don’t retire my own kind.  We don’t run.  Only old models run.SAPPERYou new models.  You’re happy scraping the shit.  You’ve never seen a miracle.Sapper gives a zealot’s grin.  Ready to die for a cause only he understands.  Eager for it.  HE RUSHES K.THE GUN THUNDERS.HOLD ON THE GUN.  So we only HEAR Sapper’s body DROP.K breathes heavy.  Checks his wound.  Sees his BLOOD on his FINGERS.Blood trickles onto fallen sheet music.  Staining Chopin.K smooths himself back to dignity.  Leans over the body.  Then PAUSES.  Crosses the room.  Finds a spoon.  Hesitates.Tastes the soup.  Hmmm.  Garlic.EXT. FARMHOUSE. MOMENTS LATER.K steps out.  Looks up at a sliver of sun eking through the dense clouds.  The Pilotfish is hovering above the farm.In one hand he holds SAPPER’S GLASSES.  In the other he holds a small, clear CASE.  INSIDE IS SAPPER’S EYE.  He staggers toward his Spinner.  Gestures to the Pilotfish.KPhotograph everything.The Pilotfish rises to take pictures of the farm. 6.INT. SPINNER.K taps a button on the dash.  An LAPD LOGO comes up.KMadam, please.ON SCREEN comes the perpetually disappointed face of LT. JOSHI.  A 50ish woman.  Ambitious, officious, impatient.  K’s backtalk gives fuel to her irritation so she tolerates it.  Or maybe she just likes the look of him.  More than she should.  She sees his BLOODY shoulder.JOSHI (ON SCREEN)You’re hurt.  I’m not paying for that.KI’ll glue it.JOSHI (ON SCREEN)And?In answer K holds up the CASE with SAPPER’S EYE.  The pinprick of his CODE below the cornea.  It SCANS.  Sapper’s SERIAL NUMBER and history open.  A NEXUS 8 for the curious.JOSHI (ON SCREEN) (cont’d)One of the tail end Nexus 8s before Prohibition.

Every floor like a town square.K walks past and to his apartment.  A BOY, brown-faced, missing an ear, looking up at K, with curiosity and fear.  K opens the lock.  Disappears inside.

K’S APARTMENT.A sparsely adorned space in clear contrast to his neighbors.  No pretense of cultural heritage.  A simple chair.  On its arm a valueless paperback novel, well-thumbed, noted, creased.  Nabokov’s maddening “PALE FIRE” as it happens, not that we make a thing of it.K walks in with his package, trying to be discreet, he hides it as...He turns on a CONSOLE.  Perhaps a MUSIC PLAYER, which spins a SINATRA song, “Summer Winds.”K takes off his coat.  Seems more annoyed at the scalpel tear in the fabric than the shoulder wound he sustained under it.WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)K!  I didn’t hear you.

PROJECTED from a hard line CONSOLE unit mounted on tracks along the ceiling, and restricting her existence to this space.  Goddess, girlfriend, geisha and, right now, goddamn bombshell.  Ingeniously real in every way except the one that counts.She holds a plate of steak frites.  Not real of course.  An illusion of satisfaction.  Just like Joi in her APRON over a sweater set and pearls.  Waiting for him with dinner on the table and drink in hand like a cartoon 60s housewife.(NOTE:  Joi cannot interact with physical objects.  Any “object” she manipulates is a holo representation, like her.  Nor does she move when unobserved by K; when he turns away for any length of time she shifts into idle animations.)JOI (cont’d)Voila.  Bon appetit.She sets the plate atop his sad prefab bowl of actual food.  Kisses him on the cheek.CLOSE ON:  HIS SKIN.  Brushed by the butterfly kiss of her cloud.  Palpable but not tangible. 15.JOI (cont’d)I missed you, babysweet.KHoney, it’s beautiful.JOIJust put your feet up.  Relax.K is moved by the gesture.  He puts the cigarette to his lips.

He blows the smoke into Joi, making her hologram all the more dense and real.They look at each other.  Joi studies him.  She looks to the shelf.  Notes Sapper’s glasses.JOI (cont’d)Was a day, huh?K(heavy)It was a day.Her form seamlessly reverts back to her lissome baseline.  Companionate, respectable, smart.  The way he likes her.  She “picks up” his copy of “Pale Fire,” hoping to cheer him up.JOIWould you read to me.  I’m dying to know what happens next.KYou hate that book.K smiles.  She throws the book behind her back.  The book disappears as it flies.JOII don’t want to read either.  Let’s dance.She straightens.  Arm up to receive his and be led, wearing now a beautiful dress.  And with that Joi wins.  K has no choice but to put his day behind him.JOI (cont’d)You wanna dance, or you wanna open your present? 16.JOI (cont’d)A present?Joi looks elated.JOI (cont’d)What’s the occasion?KOur anniversary.JOIIs it?K smiles.

WALLACE CORP, E&C.K taps the emanator and, with a CHIME...  Joi comes back online.  THE EMANATOR conjures her even more realistically in every way.  She moves about, her image unbroken as it was when projected from the hard line.  She TWIRLS about, the pleats in the new dress conjured for the effect billow out.

She leads his hand to her waist.  As if to dance.She leans in close to his neck.  Her exhaled “breath” tickles his lips.  A smoky wet dream.  He kisses her.  She looks deep in his eyes.  K kisses her neck, slowly... not breaking the illusion...  The moment intensifies-- her breath escaping -- HER IMAGE GOES STATIC --THEN FREEZES -- her face in a rictus of ecstacy, gorgeous in motion but the single frame out of context appears vulgar.Joi’s face replaced by AN EMERGENCY PAGE.  “VOICE MESSAGE.
